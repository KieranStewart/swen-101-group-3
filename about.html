    <div style="background-color: white; border-radius: 10px; font-family: cursive;">
        <p>We chose mental health as our topic, and decided to create a web portal that could house many resources, both for people struggling with their mental health and for others wishing to spread awareness. The main goal of this project is to spread awareness on the importance of mental health, showcase the broad spectrum of mental illness, and supply relevant resources for those with mental illness or those who are struggling with their mental well-being.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project is to prevent the misunderstanding of individuals struggling with mental illnesses or their mental well-being and to connect people who need mental help to the resources they need, that are nearby or accessible remotely. We hope to create an easily accessible website or app that is visually appealing and user friendly. Profiles or accounts that users create will be secure and their privacy will be our top priority. In the website, users will be able to connect with a professional who can help analyze and assist with treating any mental issues they have.</p>
